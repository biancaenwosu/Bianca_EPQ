            <p class = "link_comment">'a href' is how you link something to another website or page.
I added the '#' because it isn't linking to anything just yet but in place is where you would add the link 
to the website or page location on your computer. After it you can add the name of the link. I chose to call
it 'Click Here!'.

            <p class = "link_comment">The colour of the writing will be black but the surrounding will be white.
The 'text-decoration' is the blue colour and outline that hyperlinks usually have, so by removing it I am free to add
my own text decorations.

            <p class = "task3_comment">div is a good way of sectioning the program so that
everything you need to edit is in it's own space and to preven confusion. Make sure to used
meaningful names when naming the div class or the div id so that anyone else reading the code
understands it too
            </p>

            </code>
            <p class = "task3_comment">Just like the first section because I made a div class I 
will use a full stop (.) reference the div. If i used id instead of class I would use a hashtag (#).
Padding is a functionality of CSS and it means how big of an area the decoration covers.
Padding has top,bottom,left and right. Just write it in the form: padding-(direction). it can be in any units
even percentages.

            <p class = "task4_comment">Using all the skills we have learnt we can make a navigation bar.
The 'brand' div is where we write the title of a website and the menu is the different navigation options.
You can make as many or as little as you want and design it however you like but remember to keep 'class' 
and 'id' names meaningful so that it's understandable and readable.

work as well. 'display: flex' just means that it will auto-align with the width of the page.
'Font-size' indicates the size of the font and can be measured by an units and percentages.
Margins are the distance between objects and the specified edge. There is bottom,top,right and left 
and it can be written as: margin-(direction).
